## About

The brief for this website is to provide a company with a beta test site to gauage the interaction and effectiveness of their childrens educational app idea before they progress with the app build. The idea driving the app build is to utilise educational videos and fun videos on youtube that children may already be familiar with and test how much information the children actually retain. The team want to see if developing mini quizes with a reward at the end would enhance memory retention and improve their understanding of the subject and encourage further learning. 

The quiz to be built will be given the unique name of Splanets and will improve their understanding of the solar system when watching th following fun and educational video by KidsLearningTube; The Planet Song - 8 Planets of the Solar System Song for Kids

The target audience will be Children aged 6-12 years. The quiz format should refernce the video and should then present the user with multiple choice questions and answers based purely on the information provided within the video. The emphasis from the brief is to keep the learning and testing of knowledge fun whilst challenging.
